    <p>Just 15 minutes from the Temple Inn & Suites you will find the 
        Oakland California Temple. Located in the city of Oakland, California, 
        it is the only LDS temple built with a modern five-spire design and 
        exhibits an Oriental motif. Its architect was Harold W. Burton. The 
        exterior of the temple is reinforced concrete faced with sierra white 
        granite from Raymond, California. On the north and south faces of 
        the temple are two decorative friezes; it is the last LDS temple to 
        have such. The back (south side) is a depiction of Christ descending 
        from heaven to the people of the American continent soon after his 
        resurrection in the Holy Land. The front (north side) illustrates 
        Christ preaching his gospel to the people. Within the front garden 
        courtyard there is a statue of children in front of a bronze plaque 
        bearing a scripture from 3 Nephi chapter 17, from the Book of Mormon, relating how Christ blessed the children during his visit to the people of ancient America.

        The temple sits on a prominent site in the Oakland hills and has 
        become a local landmark. Through the front courtyard are stairways 
        which lead to the temple terrace situated above the ground floor of 
        the temple. From the temple grounds and terrace are views of the Bay 
        Area, including downtown Oakland, the Bay Bridge, Yerba Buena Island, 
        downtown San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge. The grounds are 
        accented by flowers, palm trees, and a formal-style man-made river 
        running from one fountain to the other.
        
        The temple was built on an 18.3-acre (74,000 m2) plot, has four ordinance 
        rooms, seven sealing rooms, and has a total floor area of 95,000 
        square feet (8,800 m2).
