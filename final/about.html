        <h2>Why The Olive Branch?</h2>
        <img src="images/olivebranch.jpg" alt="olive branch">
        <p>After so many days of travel, Noah and his family were anxious 
            to find a place to land. Not only were they ready to get out of 
            the boat and stretch their legs, they were hoping to find a safe 
            place that would enable them to build an altar and worship. In Genesis 
            chapter 8 we read how Noah sent forth a dove to see if the waters had 
            abated. After each reconnaissance mission, the weary dove returned 
            home to the ark. Finally the dove is sent out and brings back good 
            news in the form of an olive branch, <q>so Noah knew that the waters 
            were abated from off the earth.</q>  We at Temple Inn &amp; Suites 
            want to be that place of rest for weary travelers looking for an 
            opportunity to worship at the altars of the temple. </p>
