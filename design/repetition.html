        <img src="images/repetition.png" alt="Example of Repetition">
        <p>There is a reason that the word remember is said so many times in the Book of Mormon. It is because humans learn by repetition. When you use repetition in your website, it gives the user a sense of continuity and consistency. This can be accomplished by way of fonts, alignment, colors, and specific words or phrases. In this case, Skippy Peanut Butter, repeats the basic color scheme throughout the website that is consistant with the label on their jars. Also, they use the word peanut butter as often as they can. They even went so far as to aquire the website name of peanutbutter.com. In this way, the user will make a firm connection between the product peanut butter and the brand Skippy.
