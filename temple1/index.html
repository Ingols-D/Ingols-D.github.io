  <p>President Gordon B. Hinckley presided at a groundbreaking ceremony for the Oquirrh Mountain Utah 
      Temple on December 16, 2006. In attendance were President Thomas S. Monson and President James E. 
      Faust, Counselors in the First Presidency; Elder Russell M. Nelson of the Quorum of the Twelve 
      Apostles, who conducted the service; and other members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and 
      Quorums of the Seventy.</p>

  <p>South Jordan, Utah, where the Oquirrh Mountain temple will be located, will be the first city in 
      the world to have two temples. The Jordan River Utah Temple is also located in the city. The new 
      temple will be the 13th in Utah.</p>

        <h2>A History of Temples</h2>
  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that temples had always been a hallmark of true followers of the living 
      God, so far as the records reveal, no professing Christians, other than the Nephites, built a temple
       between the destruction of the Temple of Herod and the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ 
       of Latter-day Saints in 1830—a period of 1,760 years. Since a knowledge concerning temples, their 
       purpose, and the work to be performed in them was not to be found among men on earth during all
        this time, the question arises: Whence came a knowledge of temples to the Prophet Joseph? It is 
        certain that he did not obtain such knowledge from men, because they did not have it. The answer 
        is, of course, he received it from heaven through direct revelation.</p>
    
    <p>The building of temples today is, therefore, distinctively an activity of the Church of Jesus 
        Christ. Temples can be conceived by no people other than members of the Church who possess an 
        understanding of the gospel of Jesus Christ. The great eternal principles of preexistence, eternal 
        marriage, resurrection, exaltation, the nature of God and our relationship to him—all of these 
        and the other great principles of the gospel focus upon temple work. From the temples they are 
        reflected back into the hearts of understanding Latter-day Saints.</p>

    <p>Temples are necessary to a complete organization of the Church. “The Church,” said the Prophet, 
        “is not fully organized, in its proper order, and cannot be, until the Temple is completed, where 
        places will be provided for the administration of the ordinances of the Priesthood.”</p>

    <p>Temples are great fortresses for righteousness in the world. The devil opposes them. He so 
        stirred the enemies of our people after the first temples were built that the Saints were required 
        to move away from Kirtland and Nauvoo. Without the great outpouring of spirit and power given in 
        those temples, it is doubtful whether the Church could have survived.</p>

    <p>Temples are to us all what Bethel was to Jacob. Even more, they are also the gates to heaven for 
        all of our unendowed kindred dead. We should all do our duty in bringing our loved ones through 
        them.</p>
